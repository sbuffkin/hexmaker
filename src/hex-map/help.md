## Drawing tools

### Road / River
Paint a connected chain of road or river hexes. Left-click hexes to extend the chain; right-click a hex already in the chain to remove it. Each chain is drawn as a colored line connecting adjacent hexes.

### Terrain
Opens the terrain palette. Select a color/icon to enter paint mode, then left-click hexes to apply that terrain. Use **Pick** (⌖) to sample terrain from an existing hex. Use **Clear** to erase terrain from hexes. Right-click the terrain button to open the palette editor where you can reorder, rename, recolor, and add terrain types.

### Icon
Opens the icon palette. Select an icon to enter paint mode, then left-click hexes to apply a custom icon override (independent of the terrain icon). Useful for marking notable locations. Every icon list (here, in the token editor, and in the hex editor) has a filter box and **All / Terrain / Space / Custom** tabs; drag the bottom edge of an inline icon list to make it taller.

### Link table
Opens a folder-tree picker scoped to your Tables folder. Select a random-encounter table, then left-click hexes to link that table into each hex's **Encounters Table** section.

### Factions
Opens a folder-tree picker scoped to your Factions folder. Select a faction note, then left-click hexes to link it into each hex's **Factions** section.

### Swap
Swap the contents of two hex positions by renaming their files.

1. **Select** the first hex — highlighted amber (source)
2. **Select** a second hex — highlighted purple (destination)
3. **Select the destination again** to confirm the swap

Selecting the source hex again cancels the selection. Selecting a different hex while a destination is already highlighted changes the destination.

### Token
Create a note-backed token (icon, shape, size, colors, description) and place it on the map. The **Token** button opens the token editor, then left-click a hex to place it. Alternatively, **right-click a hex → "Create token here"** creates the token directly on that hex with no placement step. Right-click a placed token to edit, open its note, or remove it.
